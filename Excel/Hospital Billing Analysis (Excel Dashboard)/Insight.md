Insight Summary: Hospital Billing Analysis
1. Billing by Medical Condition and Insurance Provider

The analysis shows that billing amounts vary
noticeably across medical conditions and insurance providers.
Across all conditions, Aetna, Blue Cross,
and UnitedHealthcare consistently show
higher billing totals, while Medicare and Cigna
tend to fall slightly lower than the private insurers.

Obesity and Hypertension appear to attract
the highest billing amounts across multiple insurers.

Arthritis and Asthma generally have 
slightly lower billing totals compared to other conditions.

This suggests that chronic and lifestyle-related 
conditions may drive more healthcare spending across providers.

2. Billing by Medical Condition and Age Group

The stacked column chart indicates that billing 
increases progressively with age across all conditions.

The older age groups (73–82 and 83–92) consistently
contribute the highest billing amounts.

Younger age groups (23–32 and 33–42) represent the lowest share of total billing.

The pattern is uniform across
Arthritis, Asthma, Cancer, Diabetes, Hypertension, and Obesity.

This reflects the higher healthcare
needs and longer treatment durations usually associated with elderly patients.

3. Condition-Level Filtering (Slicer Insights)

Using the slicer, each medical condition can be isolated for deeper insight.
Across most conditions, the distribution of billing remains consistent:

Higher billing in older age brackets

Similar insurer patterns where UnitedHealthcare,
Aetna, and Blue Cross lead in billing totals

This confirms the reliability 
of the trends seen in the combined charts.

Overall Conclusion

The hospital billing data shows clear trends:

Age is a major cost driver, with elderly patients
accounting for the majority of billing across all conditions.

Insurance providers differ in total billing,
with private insurers generally producing higher charges than public ones.

Chronic conditions (Hypertension, Obesity, Diabetes) 
drive the highest billing amounts, indicating their 
significant impact on hospital revenue and patient care needs.

These insights can help hospitals optimize resource planning,
improve cost management, and better
understand patient demographics influencing healthcare spending.
